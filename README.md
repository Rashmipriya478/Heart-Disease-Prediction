# Heart-Disease-Prediction

*Heart Disease Prediction Project: Harnessing Data for Life-Saving Insights* 🚀

I'm thrilled to share my latest data science project focused on heart disease prediction, showcasing my skills in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. This project highlights my ability to tackle complex problems and deliver actionable insights, aligning perfectly with my goal to secure a data scientist role. Here's an overview of what I accomplished:

🔍 *Data Exploration & Visualization*:
- Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to preprocess and analyze the dataset.
- Created comprehensive visualizations with Seaborn and Plotly to uncover patterns and trends in the data.
- Employed techniques like histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to understand the distribution and relationships among features.

📊 *Feature Engineering & Correlation Analysis*:
- Conducted feature engineering to enhance the predictive power of the model.
- Analyzed the correlation between features using heatmaps and correlation matrices to identify key predictors of heart disease.

🧠 *Model Building & Evaluation*:
- Built multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest
- Leveraged Scikit-learn for model training, validation, and hyperparameter tuning.
- Evaluated model performance using critical metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

📈 *Advanced Performance Metrics*:
- Implemented ROC curves and AUC scores to measure the models' discriminatory ability.
- Used confusion matrices to analyze the classification results in-depth.
- Focused on optimizing recall and precision to balance false positives and false negatives effectively.

💡 *Key Takeaways*:
- Gained valuable insights into the factors contributing to heart disease, providing potential avenues for preventive healthcare measures.
- Demonstrated proficiency in end-to-end data science processes, from data wrangling to model deployment.
